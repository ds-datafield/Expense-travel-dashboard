### Key Features:
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboards**: View and track your expenses for each country visited.

- **Currency Conversion**: The form includes automatic conversion of expenses into different currencies.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple data input through the Google Form for quick and easy expense tracking while traveling.


## How It Works

1. **Google Apps Script Form**: 
   - Users input their travel expenses in a Google Form.
   - The form automatically feeds the data into a Google Sheet.
   - The script fetches exchange rates and converts currencies as needed.

   
2. **Tableau Dashboards**:
   - The data from the Google Sheet will be used to populate the Tableau dashboards.
   - The dashboards provide a visual representation of your expenses, categorized by country, type of expense, and time spent.


## Technologies Used

- **Tableau** for data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Google Apps Script** for data collection and automation
- **GitHub** for version control and repository hosting


## How to Use

### Prerequisites:

- A Google Account to access Google Sheets and Google Apps Script.
- A [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) account to visualize and publish dashboards.

  

### How to set up:

1. Duplicate the Google Sheet Template

    -Open the template: [Google Sheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V_4RcWsyNWgzNP_7QEtNAxImFlHakryq-sET4CKB7vM/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
   
    -Click **File > Make a copy** to save it to your own Google Drive.
   
    -Grant **Google App Script** the necessary permissions to access your sheet when prompted.

3. Download the Tableau Workbook

    -Get the file: [Tableau Workbook](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/davis.data/viz/ExpenseDashboard_17388573556900/NeutralDashboard)

4. Connect Your Google Sheet to Tableau

    -Open the Tableau Workbook in **Tableau Desktop**.
   
    -Replace the existing data source with your newly **duplicated Google Sheet**.
   
    -Ensure that all fields are correctly mapped.

Now your expense dashboard is set up and ready to use! ðŸš€

## Troubleshooting

- **Tableau is not updating with new data?**  
  â†’ Ensure you've manually refreshed the data source in Tableau.  

- **Google Apps Script is not working?**  
  â†’ Check that permissions were granted correctly.  

- **Exchange rates not appearing?**  
  â†’ Verify your internet connection and ensure the API is accessible.


## Disclaimer

The original idea was to feed the Tableau Dashboard live and track expenses while traveling. While this is possible with Tableau Desktop, the **public version does not support live connections**. As a result, to properly use this dashboard, you will need to **manually update the data source** in Tableau whenever new expenses are added.
